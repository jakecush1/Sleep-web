There are apps developed like Daylio to track personal wellness and lifestyle habits.  These apps can point out habits which may be negatively affecting your sleep.  Some of these habits can be changed easily like:
- ....
While others like .... are not always so easy to change.

Mental health and environment can affect [Sleep Quality](<Measures of Sleep Quality>).  
## Mental-health / environmental factors

- **[Anxiety](Anxiety.md) (and depression) interacting with sleep** — systematic reviews showing bidirectional relationship between anxiety/depression and insomnia; treating sleep can improve anxiety and vice versa. [PMC article 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3669059/)
    
## Medications affecting sleep
Different Medications can have varying affects on sleep in many different ways, some positive, some negative.  However many people are on medication which could affect their quality of sleep.  Though [Measures of Sleep Quality](Measures of Sleep Quality.md) can be controversial,  67% of Canadians are on some kind of prescribed medications according to [statsCanada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2022001/article/00011-eng.htm#:~:text=Overview%20of%20the%20study,Related%20information).   According to a recent [Harvard study,](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-your-medications-keeping-you-up-at-night) many of these common medications often poorly affect people sleep.  In the following text I'll  explore some of the most common medications and their affects on sleep.

#### Types of Medications
- **[ADHD medications (stimulants & non-stimulants)](ADHD-Medications.md)** — review of how stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) and non-stimulants affect sleep (children & adults). [PMC+2PMC+2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3441938)
- **[Antipsychotics](Antipsychotics.md)** — reviews on antipsychotic effects on sleep: sedation, somnolence, insomnia, and drug-specific differences. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10333591/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- [AntiDepressents](AntiDepressents.md) — review of antidepressants’ effects on REM sleep, sleep architecture, and sleep-related adverse events. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 
Antidepressants are generally used to treat depression and anxiety, but they can have many varying side effects depending on the drug.  SSRI's or fluoxetine can be stimulating and make it hard to fall asleep, while others can be more sedating, according to a [Harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-your-medications-keeping-you-up-at-night).  However, its also important to note that midnocturnal insomnia is the most frequent residual symptom of depression; in other words people with depression often have trouble sleeping without taking antidepressants.

#### Varying side effects

It is interesting that these different drugs are used to treat the same symptoms but can have varying effects on sleep.  It's important to note that there can be many factors which can affect this situation, including time of administration, dose, kind of antidepressant and duration of treatment.  
many antidepressants with so-called activating effects (e.g. fluoxetine, venlafaxine) may disrupt sleep, while others with sedative properties (e.g., doxepin, mirtazapine, trazodone) rapidly improve sleep (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **[Cannabis](Cannabis.md) / cannabinoids** — systematic reviews on cannabis and sleep (mixed/limited evidence; small benefits in some populations, especially chronic pain). [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34546363/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **[Alcohol](Alcohol.md)**— reviews on acute effects of presleep alcohol (shorter sleep onset but disrupted architecture — increased SWS early, suppressed REM early, later fragmentation). [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3987855/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **[Melatonin](Melatonin.md)**— meta-analyses and systematic reviews of melatonin for sleep onset insomnia and chronic insomnia (effect sizes modest, better for circadian problems/children). [PubMed+2PubMed+2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36179487/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
