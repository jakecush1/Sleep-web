The Oura Ring gen 3, alongside with its proprietary Oura Sleep Staging Algorithm is a device that can track sleep quality for users. It includes metrics such as time in bed, total sleep times, deep sleep time, [[REM sleep]], and more.

A study was done comparing the results of this Oura ring to that of polysomnography, the standard for sleep quality tests. The study looked at 96 adults in Japan, and monitored them for 3 consecutive nights. The participants wore two gen 3 Oura rings, one on each hand, and a one gen 2 aura ring (although data from the gen 2 ring was not included). The sleep information from the Oura rings were gathered and compared to the results obtained from the Polysomnography test. The researchers found that overall the results obtained from the Oura rings were very similar to the results obtained from the polysomnography, with the Oura rings giving a slight underestimation on [[REM sleep]] duration.

The researchers concluded that Oura Gen 3 was a good enough tool for individual users to monitor their own sleep health, although was not an outright replacement for a clinical Polysomnography test.

This study is peer-reviewed. It should be noted that this study was funded by Oura. A limitation of this study is that it was done using the Oura Sleep Staging Algorithm 2.0, future updates could potentially weaken the algorithm.
