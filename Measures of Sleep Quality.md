We must measure [[Sleep Quality]], but how can we do that? 

# PSQI 
A professional method for evaluating sleep quality is the [Pittsburgh Quality Sleep Index (PSQI)](https://www.sleep.pitt.edu/psqi). The PSQI was created nearly 40 years ago and has enjoyed widespread adoption. It measures self-reported and objective measures of sleep quality over a time period of one month. The creators would like for you to cite them if you use it, but given the time constraints of this class I think that you will not have time to use it! 

The PSQI [questionnaire](https://www.sleep.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/assets/Instrument%20Materials/PSQI_AU1.4_eng-USori.pdf) examines several qualities of sleep, including: 
- bedtime 
- time to enter sleep 
- time of waking 
- duration of sleep 
and 
- respiration 
- feeling too cold/warm 
- nightmares 
- pain 
- medicine 

# Polysomnography
Polysomnography, often called a "sleep study", is an objective measure of sleep quality. This requires much greater access to data than one would normally have available, including brain waves, blood oxygen levels, heart rate, as well as eye and leg movements. 

It is a common means to diagnose [[Sleep Disorders]] such as sleep apnea. 

While curtial to diagnosis, polysomnographic studies are time-consuming and expensive. 


Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Mini-Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), SLEEP-50 Questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).


# Wakefulness After Sleep Onset (WASO)
Measured by actigraphy, a wearable sleep test which measures movement during sleep usually over the course of several weeks. 

The following image shows an Actiwatch Spectrum 2, a device used to measure sleep activity. Along side it there is an actogram of a subject's sleep activity over the course of a week. This would be highly convenient to do a study with if one had access to such a device.
