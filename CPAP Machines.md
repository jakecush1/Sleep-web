Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines are one of the most widely used treatments for sleep apnea.  Sleep Apnea is a condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep often due to blocked airway. These machines use a gentle, constant flow of air delivered through a mask to keep the airway open. 

While CPAP’s main purpose is physiological—preventing airway collapse—it also has important cognitive implications. By ensuring that the brain receives consistent oxygen and uninterrupted rest, CPAP directly enhances cognitive functions impaired by sleep fragmentation, such as attention, memory consolidation, and executive processing. Studies have shown that individuals who use CPAP therapy regularly often experience measurable improvements in alertness and cognitive performance during the day, due to improved [[Sleep Quality]]
