One's [[Sleep Quality]] is greatly affected by the environment one chooses to sleep in. The term "environment" can mean a lot of things, though, and for this document we focus on qualities of one's environment that are readily changed or measured by computers. 

# Light 
Explain light therapy here pls 

[This study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079215001136) shows that light therapy is an effective means to treat sleep problems, but that it doesn't have too pronounced of an impact. Paywall warning... again... don't you just love paywalls?? 

There is also the effect of [[Sleep Quality and Blue Light|blue light]], for which a separate node is written. 

# Temperature 
Now [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352721817302346)'s really cool! Some researchers stuck elderly people in temperature-controlling thermosuits to decrease nocturnal wakefulness. It works in younger people, too, but to a reduced degree. I would love to read more but this paper is paywalled so I cannot. It may be useful if you're looking for references though. 

# Noise 
Noise is a factor that results in elevated levels of sleep disturbances, particularly in urban areas. 

## White Noise 
White noise is [found](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34049045/) to improve sleep quality among individuals bothered by urban noise. In this particular study, sleep quality was measured by [[Measures of Sleep Quality#Wakefulness After Sleep Onset (WASO)|Wakefulness After Sleep Onset]] and [[Measures of Sleep Quality#Sleep Latency|Sleep Latency]]. 

# Mattress Firmness 
Mattress architecture is serous business! This [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12071755/) compares the sleep outcomes of soft, medium, and firm mattresses using [[Measures of Sleep Quality#Polysomnography|polysomnography]]. 

I am not sure how to study this with computers! 

Indeed, something as simple as [[Sleep Quality and Environment#Mattress Firmness|the firmness of one's mattress]] can have a drastic impact on [back pain](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41606-022-00073-x) throughout one's day. 


# Familiarity 
Again, not so related to computers so idk about this one. It'd be fun to know through!
