**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Many antipsychotics have antihistaminergic and other sedative properties that increase sleepiness; others (partial agonists, activating agents) may worsen insomnia for some patients. Drug class and receptor profile matter. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC487011/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Typical effects**

- **Positive:** some antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine at low doses) are sedating and commonly used off-label for insomnia, and many patients report subjective sleep improvement. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC487011/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Negative:** sedation, daytime somnolence, and paradoxical insomnia have been reported; antipsychotics can fragment sleep or cause other sleep-related adverse events. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10333591/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Practical takeaways**

- Antipsychotics are not first-line for primary insomnia due to side effects and metabolic/long-term risks; use should be guided by psychiatric indication, not only sleep complaints. Monitor sedation and daytime functioning. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC487011/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
