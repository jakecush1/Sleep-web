### stimulants: methylphenidate, amphetamines; non-stimulants

**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Stimulant ADHD medications increase central catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine) which raise arousal and can delay sleep onset and reduce sleep efficiency. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3441938/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- However, in some adults/children, **improved daytime symptom control** (less bedtime hyperactivity or resistance) can paradoxically improve sleep for some patients â€” results are heterogeneous and dose/timing dependent.

**Typical effects**

- **Negative:** increased sleep onset latency, reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency in many studies, especially at higher doses or when taken late in the day. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4887346/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Possible positive:** some adult studies show improved sleep efficiency when ADHD symptoms are controlled (depends on formulation and timing). [AASM](https://aasm.org/journal-sleep-methylphenidate-can-have-sleep-benefits-in-adults-with-adhd/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Practical takeaways**

- Monitor timing: morning dosing or avoiding late-day doses reduces sleep impact. [Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/136/6/1144/77091/Stimulant-Medications-and-Sleep-for-Youth-With?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- If sleep problems occur, clinicians may adjust dose, formulation (short vs long acting), or consider alternative meds (non-stimulants) and sleep hygiene/CBT-I. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3441938/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
