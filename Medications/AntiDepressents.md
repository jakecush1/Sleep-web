**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Many antidepressants suppress REM sleep and increase REM latency (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs generally), altering sleep architecture; some (mirtazapine, trazodone) are sedating and can improve subjective sleep. Antidepressants can also induce or worsen movement-related sleep disorders in some cases (e.g., RLS, bruxism). [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
**Typical effects**

- **REM suppression** (common), increased wake after sleep onset for some drugs, and drug-dependent effects on sleep continuity. Some sedating antidepressants increase total sleep time and improve sleep quality subjectively. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Practical takeaways**

- Choice of antidepressant matters if sleep is a major symptom: choose sedating (if hypersomnia) vs activating agents thoughtfully; monitor for sleep-related side effects. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) remains a key nonpharmacologic option. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
