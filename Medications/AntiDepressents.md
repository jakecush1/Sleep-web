Antidepressants are generally used to treat depression and anxiety, but they can have many varying side effects depending on the drug.  SSRI's or fluoxetine can be stimulating and make it hard to fall asleep, while others can be more sedating, according to a [Harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-your-medications-keeping-you-up-at-night).  However, its also important to note that midnocturnal insomnia is the most frequent residual symptom of depression; in other words people with depression often have trouble sleeping without taking antidepressants.

#### Varying side effects

It is interesting that these different drugs are used to treat the same symptoms but can have varying effects on sleep.  It's important to note that there can be many factors which can affect this situation, including time of administration, dose, kind of antidepressant and duration of treatment.  

many antidepressants with so-called activating effects (e.g. fluoxetine, venlafaxine) may disrupt sleep, while others with sedative properties (e.g., doxepin, mirtazapine, trazodone) rapidly improve sleep (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

In order to achieve better sleep quality it's important to understand the effects that antidepressants can have on sleep.

- Many antidepressants suppress REM sleep and increase REM latency (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs generally), altering sleep architecture; 

- some (mirtazapine, trazodone) are sedating and can improve subjective sleep. 
- Antidepressants can also induce or worsen movement-related sleep disorders in some cases (e.g., RLS, bruxism). [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
**Typical effects**

- **REM suppression** (common), increased wake after sleep onset for some drugs, and drug-dependent effects on sleep continuity. Some sedating antidepressants increase total sleep time and improve sleep quality subjectively. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Practical takeaways**

- Choice of antidepressant matters if sleep is a major symptom: choose sedating (if hypersomnia) vs activating agents thoughtfully; monitor for sleep-related side effects. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) remains a key nonpharmacologic option. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
