There are many different apps out there that help falling asleep by listening to sound.  Some people like to listen to calming music, or podcast to help them fall asleep.  There are different frequencies and sounds which have become popular to help fall asleep.  Lots of research has been done on using various techniques to improve sleep.  One of the most popular techniques has become [Color Noise](https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/what-noise-color-is-best-for-sleep).  There are [Mental Wellness Apps](<Mental Health Apps.md>) designed for this purpose, most people will use one of these or a music streaming service. Insight Timer is an example of an app which offers guided meditations, affirmations and calming music, focusing on [[Sleep Interupters#Anxiety|reducing anxiety]].
## Color Noise
"The color of noise refers to the distribution of its sound frequencies", according to [Northwestern Medicine](https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/what-noise-color-is-best-for-sleep) and it is a technique that is becoming popular to assist in falling asleep.  It's especially popular among those who live in places where there is more noise, like urban areas.  Dr. Malkani, who specializes in [sleep studies]([https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=23422#publications](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=23422#publications "https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=23422#publications")), says "it is important to keep the volume just low enough to be audible, but not so high that it would cause arousal from sleep."

- White Noise
	- Most popular "color noise" and contains all audible frequencies played at equal intensity.  It works well to block out all sounds.  White Noise has been said to reduce crying in babies, improve sleep, and even lower ADHD Symptoms according to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/pink-noise-sleep) It's said to work well for people who:
		- Light sleepers
		- Need help relaxing
		- Have trouble falling asleep
  
- Pink Noise
	- Pink noise contains all audible frequencies but is more powerful in the lower frequencies and less in the high ones.  This is supposed to sound softer and more natural than white noise, some say like the similar to the rustling of leaves, steady rainfall or ocean waves.  Its recommended for people who:

- Brown Noise
	- Sometimes known as red noise has even greater emphasis on the lower frequencies than pink noise.  It works better at covering up noises like starting and stopping of furnace or air conditioner.  It's supposed to sound like heavy rainfall or a strong waterfall. It's best for people who:
		- Have high anxiety or stress
		- Find white or Pink noise too harsh

Though Sound color is very popular for masking sounds and when trying to fall asleep, other sounds like ambient noise or nature sounds can work well also.  Personally I prefer podcasts and music, but will use Color Sound if the environment is quite loud.  

Of course these techniques can help sleep, but they wont work well if you have consistent poor sleep habits.  According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/magnesium-glycinate-sleep), to get the most out of white noise you should make these habits part of your nightly routine:
- **Get on a schedule.** Go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time in the morning, even on weekends.
- **Work out during the day.** Daytime [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/depression/exercise-depression) helps you fall asleep faster at night.
- **Go dark.** Create a sleep-friendly bedroom that’s quiet, dark, and at a comfortable [temperature](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/normal-body-temperature).
- **[Avoid sleep interrupters](<Sleep Interupters.md>).** Limit [caffeine](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-979/caffeine), [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-treatments), and big meals before you go to bed.
