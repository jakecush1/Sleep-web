**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Alcohol is a sedative (GABAergic effects) that can **shorten sleep onset** but disrupts sleep architecture — increases slow-wave sleep in the first half of the night and suppresses REM, often followed by REM rebound and fragmentation in the second half. Overall sleep continuity is worsened. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3987855/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Typical effects**

- Short-term: may feel like it helps you fall asleep faster but increases wake after sleep onset and reduces REM, causing non-restorative sleep. Chronic use worsens long-term sleep health. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3987855/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Practical takeaways**

- Using alcohol as a sleep aid is not recommended — it fragments sleep and impairs restorative processes; avoid drinking close to bedtime. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3987855/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
