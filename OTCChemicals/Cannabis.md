**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Evidence is mixed. Short-term use of THC/CBD may alter sleep onset and architecture, but high-quality RCT evidence is limited; benefits are more evident in people with comorbid pain or specific conditions than in healthy sleepers. Chronic use/withdrawal can worsen sleep. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34546363/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Typical effects**

- Some studies show small improvements in self-reported sleep in certain groups (e.g., chronic pain), but polysomnographic changes are inconsistent. Withdrawal from chronic cannabis often results in sleep disturbance (insomnia, vivid dreams). [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34546363/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Practical takeaways**

- Cannabis is not a reliably evidence-based general sleep aid; risks include dependence and rebound insomnia on cessation. If considered clinically (e.g., medical cannabis for pain with sleep disturbance), weigh modest benefits against risks. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34546363/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
