Melatonin is a common OTC drug used to help treat insomnia or onset sleep latency.

**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Melatonin is a chronobiotic (shifts circadian timing) and mild hypnotic. It is most effective for circadian rhythm disorders (jet lag, delayed sleep phase) and can modestly shorten sleep onset latency in some patients; evidence for large benefits in chronic insomnia is mixed. Effects depend on dose, formulation, and timing. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36179487/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Typical effects**

- Meta-analyses show small improvements in sleep onset latency and subjective sleep quality for some populations; benefits are clearer for children/adolescents with sleep onset problems and for circadian misalignment.

**Practical takeaways**

- Use timing strategically (earlier evening or several hours before desired bedtime for phase shifting); avoid assuming melatonin is a powerful hypnotic for chronic insomnia â€” combine with behavioral strategies and consult a clinician for dosing/timing.
