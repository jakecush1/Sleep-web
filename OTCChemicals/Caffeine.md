**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptors → increases arousal and delays homeostatic sleep pressure, reducing slow-wave sleep and increasing light sleep. Effects are dose and timing dependent, with meaningful effects many hours after intake. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Typical effects**

- Meta-analytic effects: increased sleep onset latency (~+9 min), reduced total sleep time (~–45 min in some pooled data), lower sleep efficiency, more wake after sleep onset; reductions in deep (N3) sleep reported. Magnitude depends on dose and how close to bedtime caffeine is consumed. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Practical takeaways**

- Avoid caffeine in the late afternoon/evening; some research suggests even morning-high doses can affect sleep depending on sensitivity. Personal sensitivity varies. [OUP Academic+1](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/4/zsae230/7815486?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
