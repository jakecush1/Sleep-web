Different Medications can have varying affects on sleep in many different ways, some positive, some negative.  However many people are on medication which could affect their quality of sleep.  Though [Measures of Sleep Quality](Measures of Sleep Quality.md) can be controversial,  67% of Canadians are on some kind of prescribed medications according to [statsCanada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2022001/article/00011-eng.htm#:~:text=Overview%20of%20the%20study,Related%20information).   According to a recent [Harvard study,](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-your-medications-keeping-you-up-at-night) many of these common medications often poorly affect people sleep.

Antidepressants are generally used to treat depression and anxiety, but they can have many varying side effects depending on the drug.  SSRI's or fluoxetine can be stimulating and make it hard to fall asleep, while others can be more sedating, according to a [Harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-your-medications-keeping-you-up-at-night).  

However, its also important to note that insomnia is one of the most frequent symptoms of depression; in other words people with depression often have trouble sleeping without taking antidepressants.  
#### Varying side effects

It is interesting that these different drugs are used to treat the same symptoms but can have varying effects on sleep.  There can be many factors which can affect the insomniac side effects of the drug, including time of administration, dose, kind of antidepressant and duration of treatment.  

many antidepressants with so-called activating effects (e.g. fluoxetine, venlafaxine) may disrupt sleep, while others with sedative properties (e.g., doxepin, mirtazapine, trazodone) rapidly improve sleep -- [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548844/).
