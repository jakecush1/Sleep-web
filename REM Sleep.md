Many studies have been done on the effect that REM sleep has on overall cognitive abilities. One of these studies looked at how REM sleep helps perpetual learning. 

This study looked at 6 healthy adults and asked them to identify a patten among distractions. The study looked at how long it took the participants to find the pattern (the less time the better). The study measure this in two phases. In the first phase, participants were tested in the evening and then again in the morning after a night of regular sleep. The study found that after a night of sleep, participants on average improved the time to find the pattern by 20 milliseconds. The second phase of the experiment had participants tested in the evening, and then again in the morning, but this time the participants had their sleep interrupted specifically when they entered the REM part of their sleep.

The study found that on days when the participants had disruptive sleep, they lost the 20 millisecond advantage they had when trying to find the pattern. 

What interesting is that this study also had a separate phase where the participants where interrupted during the slow-wave sleep phase, and when they tried to find the pattern again after a night of getting disrupted, they still had the 20 millisecond advantage. This shows how important REM sleep is for perceptual learning.
