[[Sleep Quality and Environment|Sleep Environment]] can largely effect sleep quality.  Factors such as light, noise, temperature can easily influence how easily a person falls asleep and stay asleep.  Things like [[Sleep Quality and Blue Light|blue light]] exposure before bed can make it more difficult to fall asleep.  

Additional to all of these external factors, there are many internal factors which can limit and negatively affect sleep as well, like stress, anxiety, diet and exercise.  There are many [[Mental Health Apps|wellness apps]] to help improve the following factors which can negatively impact sleep.

## Anxiety & Stress
Stress and Anxiety are known to increase cognitive and physiological arousal, which increase sleep reactivity and the chances of insomnia.  There is a strong relationship between increased anxiety and stress worsening sleep, and poor sleep increasing anxiety and stress.  It's tough to get caught in this loop.

Everyone handles these things differently, some better than others.  I like to listen to calming podcasts, and [[Sound Enhancing Sleep|calming sounds]] to help me fall asleep and alleviate this cycle.  Medication can play a role in this cycle sometimes to help, others can worsen.

### Stress
**What the literature shows / mechanisms**
- Stress and emotional arousal increase cognitive and physiological arousal (rumination, HPA axis activation), which elevates sleep reactivity and predisposes to insomnia. There is strong evidence for a **bidirectional** relationship: stress/anxiety worsen sleep, and poor sleep worsens anxiety/depression. [PMC+2PMC+2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045300/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
**Typical effects**
- Chronic stress and anxiety commonly cause difficulties initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, and nonrestorative sleep; longitudinal studies show sleep problems predict later anxiety/depression and vice versa. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6545794/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
**Practical takeaways**
- Interventions that target sleep (CBT-I, sleep hygiene, cognitive reappraisal, stress management) can reduce anxiety symptoms; conversely treating anxiety may improve sleep. Consider integrated care. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7369215/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
