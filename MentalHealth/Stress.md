**What the literature shows / mechanisms**

- Stress and emotional arousal increase cognitive and physiological arousal (rumination, HPA axis activation), which elevates sleep reactivity and predisposes to insomnia. There is strong evidence for a **bidirectional** relationship: stress/anxiety worsen sleep, and poor sleep worsens anxiety/depression.

**Typical effects**

- Chronic stress and anxiety commonly cause difficulties initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, and nonrestorative sleep; longitudinal studies show sleep problems predict later anxiety/depression and vice versa. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6545794/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Practical takeaways**

- Interventions that target sleep (CBT-I, sleep hygiene, cognitive reappraisal, stress management) can reduce anxiety symptoms; conversely treating anxiety may improve sleep. Consider integrated care. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7369215/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
