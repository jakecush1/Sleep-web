The Withings Sleep Analyzer is a thin sensor you place under your mattress that tracks your [[sleep quality]] throughout the night. It has features such as heart rate tracking, snore detection, and overall sleep analysis. All of this information is then easily accessed though an app on your smartphone.

Researchers tested this product in its ability to detect sleep apnea. It tested 118 adults who were suspected to have sleep apnea. Participants were hooked up to a polysomnography test and had the Withings sleep sensor under their mattress concurrently. The participants were tested on their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The results showed that the sleep sensor had similar results compared to the polysomnography test. The sensor was able to flag moderate to severe sleep-apnea in over 85% of cases.  This is great news for individuals who may believe they have sleep apnea, as now they can test their symptoms at home without the need of a trained technician administered a polysomnography test.

This study is not without its flaws. Some of the researchers in this study are employees of Withings. The sleep analyzer used in this study was also provided by Withings. This study also looked only at participants who were already suspected in having sleep apnea, testing on a more diverse population may yield different results. This sensor is just one tool a person could use to help diagnose sleep apnea, and should be a full replacement for a polysomnography test done by a trained healthcare professional.

Sleep Apnea heavily effects sleep quality. It disrupts all phases of sleep, such as [[REM sleep]], and ruins overall [[sleep quality]].
