As a child I was often told that blue light exposure, such as from a phone screen, was highly detrimental to [[Sleep Quality]]. Do not use any electronics for two hours before bed, they'd say, or else your sleep will be bad. The truth, as it turns out, is a bit more complicated than that! 

# Effects 
Blue light is, as it sounds, blue light. It is found naturally within sunlight and helps to create sunlight's distinctive tone. Humans rely on it to maintain a circadian rhythm, the regular frequency of one's sleep. This is achieved through the regulation of metatonin, a hormone involved in sleep that blue light exposure suppresses. 

It used to be that blue light exposure was restricted in source to sunlight. Fires, you may note, are much more red and yellow than blue. With the advent of modern technology, however, we can create screens capable of shining blue light directly into our faces at any time of day--or night!

Silvani et al. [The influence of blue light on sleep, performance and wellbeing in young adults: A systematic review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/) reviews a breadth of literature around the effects of blue light. 

Strong et al. [Narrow-band blue-light treatment of seasonal affective disorder in adults and the influence of additional nonseasonal symptoms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.20538) found that bright blue light is effective in treating seasonal affective disorder. 

Interestingly, Bjorvatn et al. [The association between insomnia and bedroom habits and bedroom characteristics: an exploratory cross-sectional study of a representative sample of adults](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352721817302346) found no association between electronic media use and chronic insomnia. It is paywalled though so I cannot read further... 

# Filtering 
Ealvo-Sanz et al. [Blue light emission spectra of popular mobile devices: The extent of user protection against melatonin suppression by built-in screen technology and light filtering software systems](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2020.1781149) is neat! 
Measures software blue light filtering and melatonin suppression. AMOLED screens are better at suppressing blue light, but such software does not significantly influence melatonin suppression! 

Chiu et al. [The effects of three blue light filter conditions for smartphones on visual fatigue and visual performance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hfm.20824) is neat! 
It studies eye strain and blue light and how it can affect performance while playing a game on one's phone. They found that performance decreased when using a blue light filter, but little impact was observed on eye strain. This was performance playing a game on one's phone, though, which I imagine has more to do with image clarity than anything else.
