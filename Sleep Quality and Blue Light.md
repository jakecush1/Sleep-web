As a child I was often told that blue light exposure, such as from a phone screen, was highly detrimental to [[Sleep Quality]]. Do not use any electronics for two hours before bed, they'd say, or else your sleep will be bad. The truth, as it turns out, is a bit more complicated than that! 

Blue light is, as it sounds, blue light. It is found naturally within sunlight and helps to create sunlight's distinctive tone. Humans rely on it to maintain a circadian rhythm, the regular frequency of one's sleep. 

It used to be that blue light exposure was restricted in source to sunlight. Fires, you may note, are much more red and yellow than blue. With the advent of modern technology, however, we can create screens capable of shining blue light directly into our faces at any time of day--or night!

Blue light and its effects on sleep have been studied [a lot](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/)! It turns out that blue light isn't all bad, it's just misunderstood (or misused). 

Blue light can [help treat seasonal affective disorder](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.20538)!

Interestingly, [another study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352721817302346) found no association between electronic media use and chronic insomnia. It is paywalled though so I cannot read further...
