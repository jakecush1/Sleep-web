Exercise and Sleep Quality :

Highly researched, connects physical behavior to cognitive recovery.
Fits perfectly with “computing systems for cognitive augmentation,” because wearables and apps (Fitbit, Oura, Apple Watch) quantify both exercise and sleep.

| Regular moderate exercise improves sleep efficiency and slow-wave sleep.| Aerobic exercise (30 min, 3×/week) increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency in older adults (King et al., 1997).     |
| Timing matters.                                                         | Evening vigorous workouts can delay sleep onset, but morning exercise stabilizes circadian rhythm (Myllymäki et al., 2011). |
| Exercise reduces insomnia symptoms.                                     | Individuals with insomnia saw shorter sleep latency after 16 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise (Reid et al., 2010).        |

Cognitive functions and naps

Naps are a mini cognitive reset — great to explore short-term augmentation (memory, alertness).
You can link it to systems for learning enhancement and attention management.

| Short naps enhance alertness and memory consolidation.     | 20-min power naps improved performance and mood (Brooks & Lack, 2006). |
| Long naps or late-day naps reduce nighttime sleep quality. | Naps > 60 min disrupt sleep architecture (Milner & Cote, 2009).        |
| Naps improve declarative memory.`                          | Post-learning naps increase hippocampal replay (Mednick et al., 2003). |

Food and beverages related to sleep

Links nutritional behavior to neurocognitive regulation of sleep.
Caffeine timing and late eating have measurable, quantifiable effects, ideal for a cognitive-augmentation focus using tracking apps or diet logs.

| Eating close to bedtime disrupts circadian rhythm and reduces Rapid eye movement . | Late meals (<2 h before bed) increase wake after sleep onset (Wehrens et al., 2017).    
| Caffeine delays melatonin release.                                                 | Caffeine 3 h before bedtime delays circadian timing by ~40 min (Burke et al., 2015).    
| Nutrient composition affects sleep.                                                | High-carb meals reduce latency but increase nighttime awakenings (Afaghi et al., 2007). |
